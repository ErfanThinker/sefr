SEFR is a fast, linear-time classifier to be used mainly on, but not limited to, ultra-low power devices. 
The data should be normalized in the range [0, n], and its labels should be 0 and 1 (this will be fixed in the next version). 
For training and prediction, fit() and predict() methods are used, the same way as in other classifiers.
